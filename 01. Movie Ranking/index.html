<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<h3>How to train your dragon</h3>
<p>
    This movie shows me how each and every one of us is special. Even those who are considered to be the worst in a society may in fact be the best, if given the chance to do what he/she is best at. <br>
    It also teaches each one of us to do what we are good at, even when the situations turns for the worst (like when toothless is caught and hiccup starts to train his friends to ride the dragons against his village rules). Unless you don't give up on what you want to do - you are always the winner :)

<h4>Quote 2</h4>
<p>
    Yesterday is History, <br />
    Tomorrow is a Mystery, <br />
    But Today is a Gift. <br />
    That is why it is called the Present. <br />

<h3>Lion King</h3>
<h4>Quote 1</h4>
<p>
    Oh Yes, the Past can Hurt. <br />
    But the way I see it,
    You can either Run from it...
    Or LEARN from it.

    Believe in Yourself, <br />
    And there will come a day when, <br />
    Others will have no choice but to believe with you. <br />
